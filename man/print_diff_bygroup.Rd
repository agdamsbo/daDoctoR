\title{Print regression results in table}
\usage{
print_diff_bygroup(meas, var, group, adj, data, dec = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{meas}{outcome measure variable name in data-data.frame as a string. Can be numeric or factor. Result is calculated accordingly.}

\item{var}{binary exposure variable to compare against (active vs placebo). As string. Horisontal.}

\item{group}{binary stratum to compare, as string. Vertical.}

\item{adj}{variables to adjust for, as string.}

\item{data}{dataframe to subset from.}

\item{dec}{decimals for results, standard is set to 2. Mean and sd is dec-1. pval has 3 decimals.}
}
\description{
New function ready for revision / rewrite

\details{
Printable table of two dimensional regression analysis of group vs variable for outcome measure. By group. Includes p-value
Group and variable has to be dichotomous factor.
