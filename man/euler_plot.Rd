\title{Creates Euler model from list of identifier numbers.}
\usage{
euler_plot(x, total, shape = "ellipse")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{list of variables included. Has to be vectors of identifier numbers.}

\item{total}{data.frame, vector or integer to calculate or use as total number of participants for percentage calculation.}

\item{shape}{same as for euler(). These includes c("circle","ellipse").}
}
\description{
Calculates relative overlaps and uses eulerr package to create Euler/Venn-diagrams. Use plot() to create diagram.
Combined with an evolved calculate.overlap() from the VennDiagram library.
Up to five (5) dimensions. Limit set by the complexity of combinations. euler() supports more.
