# daDoctoR
R functions for inspiration.

I'm currently doing my Phd at the Aarhus University in the field of clinical neuroscience. Feel free to use or be inspired.

## Using the package
The package can be downloaded into R using the command:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("agdamsbo/daDoctoR")
```

## To-do
I'm currently working on improving the code to be more universal
- Include sample data to use with special functions
- Include coding examples with all functions
